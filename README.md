# helpful poem ocr

A single-page poem viewer. Upload an image or PDF and the site runs OCR, then deliberately degrades the text (fragmentation, digit confusion) and displays it with: digits 0 and 1 rolling into *I*, math words as symbols with an oppositely synced roll, and unstable flicker on • · ~ _.

Default poem: **murmur** by Cameron Barnett (exact OCR). You can also paste your own text or leave the fields blank for the default.
