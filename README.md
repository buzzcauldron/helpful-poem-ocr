# murmur

A single-page poem viewer built around **murmur** by Cameron Barnett. Uses exact OCR text from the source PDF; digits 0 and 1 roll into *I*, math words become symbols (with an oppositely synced roll), and fragmentation characters (• · ~ _) are visually unstable.

You can paste your own poem or title; leave the fields blank for the default.
